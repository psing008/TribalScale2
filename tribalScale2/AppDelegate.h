//Hey Piyush,
//
//The assignment would be the same but here are the extra requirements:
//
//- Focus a lot on TDD when you design your solution. You could use straight up XCTest or use frameworks (there's a lot of frameworks out there)
//                                             - If time permitting, implement a few UI automation test that would be good
//                                              - Use third party dependency tool as well (for example, submodule or pods)
//                                               - Multi-thread your implementation using queues, etc...
//                                                                                        
//                                          Bonus [If time permitting]:
//                                           - Implement  a CI pipeline
//                                           - Implement a watch extension that display the list of users on the watch and upon tapping a cell, minimal user's info is displayed on the watch (be creative)
//                                           When you are done, please submit your assignment to your gihthub repo. If there are things that you don't have time to implement, please list them in your github readme.

//                             Let me know if you have any question.
//                                                                                        
//                                                                        Thanks
